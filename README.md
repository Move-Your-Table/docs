# MYT Docs

MYT Docs is a documentation server that is powered by [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a react-based documentation framework.

## Getting started

1. Clone the code with `git clone`
2. Install the needed dependencies using `yarn`
```bash
$ yarn install
```

>>>
:bulb: We suggest using Yarn for all commands.
If you don't have it, you can install it globally.
```bash
$ npm install -g yarn
```
>>>

>>>
:warning: You can *technically* build with `npm`, but we do not recommend this, as the project was build with `yarn`.
>>>

1. In the root of the project run the following command:
```bash
$ yarn start
```
âœ… Done! You should now have a development server running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
