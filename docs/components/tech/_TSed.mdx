TS.ed is a framework built with back-end, flexibility & modularity in mind.

This framework is very modular, even to it's very core.
- You can choose if you want `express.js` or `koa.js`, 2 very popular frameworks
- When creating an application, you can make it as minimal or extensive as possible.
- It has build-in support for a lot of packages, such as RabbitMQ, Swagger, etc...

Because of this, the application itself is very lightweight and has quick build times.

:::danger `FoalTS` was tossed

Originally, we were planning on using **FoalTS** as framework, but this was eventually scratched, because it came with a lot of functionality built-in that we didn't need for the front-end.
