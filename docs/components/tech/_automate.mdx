Low-Code tools are becoming more relevant in a world where developers are scarce, but we as developers can also take advantage of these tools to increase our productivity. 
Power Automate is one of these tools and allows for integrating a lot of 3rd party service, like email capabilities, calendar integrations, etc... 
But it also allows for customs API integrations, which opens up a world of possibility.

The functionality is written within a flow-based interface, which makes it a lot easier to understand for non-developers to understand what actions are being performed.
