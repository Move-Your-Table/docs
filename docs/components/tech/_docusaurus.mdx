Docusaurus is a React-based framework that is very customizable, but also very extensible.

While Gitbook is the most used documentation framework, Docusaurus has some key advantages:

- **Components & JSX**:
- **Multi-Doc**:
- **Built-in Translation & Versioning**:

And best of all? This is all **free**!
