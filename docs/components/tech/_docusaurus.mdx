Docusaurus is a React-based framework that is very customizable, but also very extensible. While Gitbook is the most used documentation framework, Docusaurus has some key advantages:

- **Components & JSX**: 
    Docusaurus allows for a component-based approach to documentation. 
    It can utilize `mdx` & `jsx` files to build it's pages, thus evading that you need to write repetitive tasks.

- **Multi-Doc**:
    Multi-Doc allows you to host multiple documentations in 1 Docusaurus project.
    Thanks to this, you can maintain all your documentation within 1 project, but separate them from each other.

- **Built-in Translation & Versioning**:
    Docusaurus comes with built-in versioning & translation for your documentation, so that you can create a truly global documentation.

And best of all? This is all **free**!
