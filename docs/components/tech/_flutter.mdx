Flutter on top of Dart makes things incredible interesting.

Compare to Multi-Platform framework, like React Native, Dart is extremely performant because it's code is directly compiled to machine code and does not require a bridge, like with React Native.

The developer experience is also less complex when compared to other frameworks. 
It only needs 1 command to spin up a test environment and makes it hard to run code that results in run-time errors.
