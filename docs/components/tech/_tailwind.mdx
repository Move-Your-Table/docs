Tailwind CSS is commonly compared to other CSS frameworks, like bootstrap, but it's methodology is completely different.
While Bootstrap and similar framework focus on the functionality of the styled item, Tailwind CSS is a utility-first framework, which focus on how a item should be displayed.

While the idea of having your CSS replaced by classes might sound daunting at first, the `@apply` function and the extensive configuration file makes the framework a perfect fit for component-based frameworks.

It also forces developers to make effective use of components within component frameworks.
Because the combined classnames are very long, the maintainability decreases if you don't make effectively use of a component system.
So, a developer learns that, next time he needs to maintain the code, that he should make more components.
It's a form of **negative reinforcement learning** that forces developers to adopt best practices.

It's also a very popular framework, being the most satisfying CSS framework in 2019 & 2020 and it's usage went from 9th place to 4th place between 2019 & 2020.
