Warp is a very lightweight webserver that is very popular within the Rust community.

It uses a special system, called a `Filter` system, which gives it a lot of functionality out of the box, such also:
- Path routing and parameter extraction
- Query string deserialization
- JSON and Form bodies

Plus, this framework is built upon **Hyper**, which is a very performant webserver with one of the fastest HTTP implementation in Rust.
