# Introduction

**Docusaurus** is our main documentation of our applications.
While currently it only contains technical documentation, we are planning to divide the documentation into 4 parts:
- Documentation
- User Manual
- Admin Manual
- Mobile Manual

Docusaurus is a documentation framework, built upon **React**, a JavaScript framework focused on components, modularity & reusability.
