# Getting started
## Setup
### Requirements
- [Docker (Desktop)](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Node.JS LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) & NPM
### Getting started
1. Copy the `.env.example` file, rename it `.env` and configure it, as described in the [`.env` configuration section](#env-configuration)
2. Install the needed packages
   ```bash
   $ yarn install
   ```
3. In the root of the directory, use the following command:
    ```bash
    # If you want to run everything in the container
    $ yarn start:container:dev

    # If you want to run the source code offline
    $ yarn start:local:dev
    ```
✅ Done! Your application should be configured & up and running. Start developing!

#### Adding other services
Because [Gateway](https://git.ti.howest.be/TI/2021-2022/s5/trending-topics/projects/hybrid-work1/gateway), [Automation API](https://git.ti.howest.be/TI/2021-2022/s5/trending-topics/projects/hybrid-work1/automateapi) and [Back-End](https://git.ti.howest.be/TI/2021-2022/s5/trending-topics/projects/hybrid-work1/back-end) share the same custom network, you can build these and get the production server up & running.

- For [Automation API](https://git.ti.howest.be/TI/2021-2022/s5/trending-topics/projects/hybrid-work1/automateapi), clone the project, navigate to the root of the project and perform the following command:
  ```bash
  $ docker-compose up rust_prod -d
  ```
- For [Gateway](https://git.ti.howest.be/TI/2021-2022/s5/trending-topics/projects/hybrid-work1/gateway), clone the project, navigate to the root of the project and perform the following command:
  ```bash
  $ yarn start:container:prod
  ```
