# Going live

:::danger WIP

For some reason, this container has problems with exposing the GraphQL endpoint, so for now, we suggest using the dev container instead.

:::

Thanks to Docker, you can easily create a production image that you can use by using this command:

```bash
$ yarn run start:container:prod
```

:::danger NPM Required
For this, you'll need to have Node installed. If you don't have this available, you can use this command instead:
```bash
$ docker-compose --profile prod up -d --build
```
:::
:::danger RabbitMQ overlap
If you've already set up the [Automate Server](../automate-server/index), you won't be able to use the previous command given. Instead, execute the following set of commands:
```bash
$ docker-compose up -d --build nestjs_prod
$ docker-compose up -d --build mongodb_prod
```
