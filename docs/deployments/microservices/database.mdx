# Document Store Service (MongoDB)
Currently, MongoDB is on 3rd place as most loved database, and compared to the conventional relational database systems, this is a document store. 
While we've used relational database in every application we've built, we haven't used a document store for a real web app.
Seeing as it popular in the cloud setting & a lot of developers want to use it, this project seems to be the perfect opportunity to explore this type of database.

Beside this, a document database is also very flexible. 
When looking at our system, the desks & room objects will benefit a lot of the document store, because the feature set of a desk of room can be very different, but also very extensive, thus a document store is a good fit for this project.
