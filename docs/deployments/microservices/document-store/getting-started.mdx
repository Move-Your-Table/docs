# Getting started

:::danger You're sure you're right?

Normally, the database is automatically build when bringing up the containers in the [back-end](https://git.ti.howest.be/TI/2021-2022/s5/trending-topics/projects/hybrid-work1/back-end/).

:::
## Requirements
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
In order to manually bring up a instance of the database, you'll need to do the following things:
1. Clone the codebase of the [Back-end repo](https://git.ti.howest.be/TI/2021-2022/s5/trending-topics/projects/hybrid-work1/back-end/).
    ```bash
    $ git git@git.ti.howest.be:TI/2021-2022/s5/trending-topics/projects/hybrid-work1/back-end.git
    ```
2. Define the `.env` file as detailed in the [`.env` configuration section](../back-end/getting-started.mdx).
3. Within the root of the project, run the following command:
    ```bash
    # If you want a development database
    docker-compose up mongodb_dev

    # If you want a production database
    docker-compose up mongodb_prod 
    ```
> âœ” Done, normally, if you've chosen the development database, you should be able to reach the MongoDB through the defined database port.
