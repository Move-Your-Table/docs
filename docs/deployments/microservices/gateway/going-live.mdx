# Going live

Thanks to Docker, you can easily create a production image that you can use by using this command:

```bash
$ yarn run start:container:prod
```

:::danger NPM Required
For this, you'll need to have Node installed. If you don't have this available, you can use this command instead:
```bash
$ docker-compose up -d tsed_prod
```
