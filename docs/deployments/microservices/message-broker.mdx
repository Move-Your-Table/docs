# Message Broker (RabbitMQ)

RabbitMQ is a message broker, that allows us to enable asynchronous processing. 

With message brokers, we can send messages between services of a micro-services architecture and let certain actions be handled by other services. 
This is great of several reasons, such as the fact that it support multiple standardized protocols and it increases scalability of apps in our microservice architecture.

Within the application, **[gateway](/gateway/index)**, **[back-end](/back-end/index)** & **[automate service](/automate-server/index)** communicate through this queue.
