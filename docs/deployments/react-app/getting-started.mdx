# Getting started

1. Clone the code with Git clone found [here](https://git.ti.howest.be/TI/2021-2022/s5/trending-topics/projects/hybrid-work1/front-end)
2. Install the needed dependencies using `yarn`
```bash
$ yarn install
```
:::tip What's Yarn?

We suggest using Yarn for all commands. 
If you don't have it, you can install it globally.
```bash
$ npm install -g yarn
```

:::

:::danger Using NPM

You can *technically* build with `npm`, but we do not recommend this, as the project was build with `yarn`.

:::
3. In the root of the project run the following command:
```bash
$ yarn start
```
âœ… Done! You should now have a development server running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
