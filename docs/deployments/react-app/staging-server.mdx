# Staging Server

For people who just want to experience the application in action, we have a staging server available that is free to access.

It's hosted on Heroku and is always up-to-date with the latest version of master thanks to our **CI/CD pipeline**.

You can access it [here](https://move-your-table-main.herokuapp.com/).

:::danger That's the thing with staging servers

Do note that this is a **staging server**. Some things can be broken or not finished.

Also, no dynamic data is available on the front-end. There's no real free hosting platform for micro-services.
