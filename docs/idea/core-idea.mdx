# Core Idea

:::tip Why is this here?

We would like to keep our original pitch somewhere save, *for old time's sake*.

:::

Move you table is an application designed for room & desk assignments in a hybrid work situation.

Old traditions dictate that everyone has 1 desk & needs to work at the office, so the company needs to buy a building that provides rooms for all employees & all activities. 
But in a hybrid environment, this mindset doesn't work anymore
- How will you know if someone's going to be at the office, if remote working is now much more common?
- What to do with the empty desks & rooms that are now in the office, rotting away?
- If a certain room is popular within the company, schedule conflicts could arise.

The solution is to provide a streamlined & efficient app that allows you to reserve a desk or room, view if your colleges will be working remote & allows a company to view the usage of the desks & rooms and maintain these if there are problems. 
This allows businesses to scale their offices & rooms to their needs & keep track of what those needs are, dictated by the employees. 
The app includes:
- A comprehensible & easy overview of all desks & meeting rooms within a building
- Statistics about a desk or room and the potential problems associated with it
- An easy way to reserve a desk or room and make these viewable for other users
- View when a college is going to be at the office or not.

So I'd suggest you take your chance to **Move Your Table**.
