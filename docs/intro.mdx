# Introduction

Welcome to **Move Your Table**, the ultimate tool for managing, reserving & maintaining desks, rooms and buildings in corporate environments!

## What is Move Your Table (MYT)?

Move Your Table is a **Hybrid Workplace Management Tool** (HWMT) that gives a more structered approach to reservations desk & rooms. 
But to understand why we need this, we first need to go back to begin 2020.

### Workplace Management *(Anno 2020)*

At most people their work, something as workplace management did **not** exist. You couldn't reserve desks or rooms and if you could, this was a very labor-intensive tasks, with a lot of room for errors, double bookings, etc...

Of course, this is not ideal. What was even worse is that around that time, the world completely shutdown thanks to [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic). Everyone needed to work from home and this came with it's own set of problems.

Back then, we believed that, when this pandemic would be over, that live will resume as usual. But as you've probably noticed, that didn't happend. Even more, remote working became a big part of our working lifestyle.

### Workplace Management *(Anno 2021)*

Everyones working lifestyle is in limbo. While in some countries, people have been able to resume their normal work lifestyle, for the majority of the people, they have either...
- ... completely switched over to remote work, allowing them to work from everywhere. (If their job allow it & they have a decent internet connection)
- ... or have a **hybrid work lifestyle**, where they have a balance of being at the office and working from home.

A lot of companies are also becoming a lot more accustomed to this work lifestyle, even having stated that when the pandemic is completely over, they woukd like to continue offering the ability to work from home.
