# API-Driven
## What?
API-Driven design is a design pattern where inter-app communication is performed with API's. These can take the form of REST API, Message Brokers, etc...

## Advantages
This design pattern has been used for a long part and with reason:
- The project is not restricted by the technology it uses and we can extend the application, independent of its technology.
- Developers can work on multiple parts of the application, while minimizing the risk of disrupting the work flow (because of Merge conflicts, etc...).
