# Micro-services
## What?
Micro-services are a relatively new thing in the technology sector, but is a fitting design pattern within the cloud revolution of today. 

The main idea is that every part **interchangeable** is and fulfills 1 function, thus being easily **scalable**.
These micro-services are contained in **containers**, making it that the code can run platform-independent.

## Components
### Service
A **service** is a individual component of the micro-services framework. In order for a service to be a service, it should adhere to the following principles:
- **Isolated**: A service activity should be isolated and should not depend on any other running services.
    If this would not be the case, the framework would fall apart when one of these services when (temporarily) offline.
- **Interchangeable**: A service should be able to be switch out, without any other services noticing that this happened.
    This can be achieved by **standardizing the API calls** and make sure that the request & response stays consistent between new service versions.
- **Independent**: Because the framework's supposed to be scalable, you'll need to make sure that the code & it's runtime environment is **platform-independent**.
    This can be achieved using **containers** and runtime environments designed for it, such as Docker 
### Gateway
The **Gateway** is the access point for other apps that wish to communicate with the services within in micro-services framework & handles authentication.
This is mostly takes form of a **REST API**.

You can compare it to a traditional REST API interface in a monolithic application.

:::tip So what's the difference?

The main different is that **the gateway does not house any data**, which would directly expose the database to the end user. 
Instead, the gateway makes calls to other services in order to retrieve data, which results in better access control between apps.

## Advantages
But why should you use micro-services? Well, ...

- It gives you **freedom** in what technologies you use, because the runtime makes the containers independent.
- Micro-services allows for **high-scalable** apps, which is important when running apps that are used worldwide.
- Deployment can be **automated** & **versioned**, thanks to the project containing all setup information needed & being able to create tagged images of your services.
